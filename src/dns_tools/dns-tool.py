 DNSSEC management tool - aka easy dnssec

 Generate and manage KSK/ZSK keys. Handle key rolling.
 Signs dns zones with ksk/zsk current key, and for phase 1 of key roll
 also signes with the next key.

 Uses the ldns tools

 zone signing does the following:

   - zone:
       - Backup zone to Prev/zone
       - Update serial and save back to zone
   - read updated zone file - this also expands in $INCLUDE files
   - sign the expanded zone file
   - write signed zone file to dated file signed/data/xxx
   - create link signed/zone.signed -> data/xxx
